# The Train Scheduler

You can use **Train Scheduler** to determine how long away any given train is, based on its frequency and first posted arrival of the day.

## Instructions
Either you may use the helpful information loaded on the page when you first visit, or you may add new entries yourself using the handy form.

Be sure to enter all fields, or it will not accept your submission! Click **Submit**, and the page will give you a new train manifest.

You can find the deployed site at https://bsessio.github.io/Train-Scheduler/
